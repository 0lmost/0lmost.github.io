        <h1>History</h1>

        <p>Welcome to Based & Kino, your number one source for all things cinema. We're dedicated to giving you the very best of experience, with a focus on quality films, theatre comfort, special events.


        Founded in 2021 by Olmo Kosunen, Based & Kino has come a long way from its beginnings in his mind. When Olmo first started out, his passion for movies drove them to start his own theatre so that Based & Kino can offer you competitive ticket prices and a different movie experience. We now serve customers all over Helsinki and Vantaa, and are thrilled that we're able to turn our passion into reality.
    
    
        I hope you enjoy my theatres as much as I enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact me.
    
    
        Sincerely,
    
        Olmo Kosunen, founder of Based & Kino</p>
